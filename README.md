# Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop an AI-assisted application that evaluates academic answer sheets by:

  1. Extracting content from handwritten or printed images or scanned PDFs.

  2. Generating scores and feedback based on predefined answer keys using LLMs.

  3. Structuring the output in a markdown format for easy review and archival.

This system is designed for academic institutions seeking to enhance grading consistency, minimize manual effort, and facilitate the digital archiving of internal assessments.


# Key Features

* Optical character recognition and visual understanding of handwritten and printed content.

* Support for single-image input or multi-page PDF-based evaluations.

* Automatic scoring and detailed feedback generation using Google's Gemini API.

* Configurable model and prompt architecture.

* Markdown-formatted output for human verification or integration into downstream systems.
